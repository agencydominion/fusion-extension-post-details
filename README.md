# Fusion Extension : Post Details

### Extend Fusion with a Post Details Element.

The Post Details Element can pull in the post title, author, post date, category, and tags added to any given page. Typically, this Element is used for individual blog post pages where you may want to pull in some or all of that data at the beginning of the post.
